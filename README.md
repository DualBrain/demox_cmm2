This is the first Demoscene for the Colour Maximite 2

(YOU NEED AT LEAST THE FIRMWARE VERSION 5.05.06 FOR CMM2 TO PLAY THIS)

There is something that I planning to change in the future, principally in the racing scene, that I need to fix the effect of the ugly wheels and inserting some trees.

The great tunes played in this demo are downloaded from modarchive.org, which the licence permits me to insert them on this demo:

- Neon Techno! by DROZERiX
- Econmy17 by xtd / mystic * trsi
- Excelatte by Probe (FLT / VD) from demo Psychedelic
- Flow1 (Floating in the ocean of sound) by mortimer t

PS.: If you have some bug at the end of the racing part, change in the RACING.INC file the command FPS(17) to something lower.
